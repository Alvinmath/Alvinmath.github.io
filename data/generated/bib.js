        "abstract": "Accurate automated medical image recognition, including classification and segmentation, is one of the most challenging tasks in medical image analysis. Recently, deep learning methods have achieved remarkable success in medical image classification and segmentation, clearly becoming the state-of-the-art methods. However, most of these methods are unable to provide uncertainty quantification (UQ) for their output, often being overconfident, which can lead to disastrous consequences. Bayesian Deep Learning (BDL) methods can be used to quantify uncertainty of traditional deep learning methods, and thus address this issue. We apply three uncertainty quantification methods to deal with uncertainty during skin cancer image classification. They are as follows: Monte Carlo (MC) dropout, Ensemble MC (EMC) dropout and Deep Ensemble (DE). To further resolve the remaining uncertainty after applying the MC, EMC and DE methods, we describe a novel hybrid dynamic BDL model, taking into account uncertainty, based on the Three-Way Decision (TWD) theory. The proposed dynamic model enables us to use different UQ methods and different deep neural networks in distinct classification phases. So, the elements of each phase can be adjusted according to the dataset under consideration. In this study, two best UQ methods (i.e., DE and EMC) are applied in two classification phases (the first and second phases) to analyze two well-known skin cancer datasets, preventing one from making overconfident decisions when it comes to diagnosing the disease. The accuracy and the F1-score of our final solution are, respectively, 88.95% and 89.00% for the first dataset, and 90.96% and 91.00% for the second dataset. Our results suggest that the proposed TWDBDL model can be used effectively at different stages of medical image analysis.",

        "abstract": "The outcome of any surgery is particularly dependent on the adequate delivery of anesthetic drugs. Not surprisingly clinical researchers have been trying to automatize their delivery in order to provide anesthesiologists with titration tools that can target the exact needs of each individual patient. As compared to today's population-normed drug delivery strategy closed-loop drug delivery systems would provide patients with customized pharmacological action, thereby improving surgery outcome. While some anesthesia closed-loop designs have already shown promising results within controlled clinical protocols, the pharmacological variability that exists between patients needs to be addressed within a mathematical framework to prove the stability of the control laws, and gain faster and wider acceptance of these systems by the clinical community and regulatory committees. This paper is the first of a series of 2 papers addressing the issue of pharmacological variability, and how this variability translates into quantifiable system uncertainty. In this work, we focus essentially on deriving patient-specific models to assess inter-patient variability. These models will serve as basis for illustrating the uncertainty quantification approach proposed in the accompanying paper.",

        "abstract": "Deep learning-based approaches have become widespread in medical fields and have achieved profound success in recent years. Nonetheless, most of these approaches cannot provide the certainty of their output numerically, and their output often has too many confidence levels. Therefore, they cannot be efficient and may even lead to irreparable damage. Accordingly, to tackle such a challenge, the Bayesian approximation and Ensemble learning techniques are deliberated as uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods. We apply and evaluate three UQ models regarding the classification of breast tumor tissue types. These methods are Mont Carlo-dropout (MCD), Bayesian Ensemble, and MCD Ensemble. Furthermore, to increase the classification's precision and eliminate the adverse effects of the smallness of the data collection in Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) used in the present research, transfer learning technique and pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (DenseNet121) are considered. Three proposed models are compared based on their ability to quantify the reliability of classification according to novel performance metrics employed to assess estimated uncertainty. Our quantitative and qualitative examinations in the study demonstrate that models show high uncertainty in misclassifications, which is vital in determining the rate of medical diagnosis risks. As a result, by using these new assessment criteria, we intend to ascertain when can trust the output of the deep neural network. Moreover, in the examination, we witness more reliability in uncertainty quantification of the Bayesian Ensemble model.",

        "abstract": "Background and objective Myocardial infarction (MI) is a life-threatening condition diagnosed acutely on the electrocardiogram (ECG). Several errors, such as noise, can impair the prediction of automated ECG diagnosis. Therefore, quantification and communication of model uncertainty are essential for reliable MI diagnosis. Methods A Dirichlet DenseNet model that could analyze out-of-distribution data and detect misclassification of MI and normal ECG signals was developed. The DenseNet model was first trained with the pre-processed MI ECG signals (from the best lead V6) acquired from the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) database, using the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence loss. The model was then tested with newly synthesized ECG signals with added em and ma noise samples. Predictive entropy was used as an uncertainty measure to determine the misclassification of normal and MI signals. Model performance was evaluated using four uncertainty metrics: uncertainty sensitivity (UNSE), uncertainty specificity (UNSP), uncertainty accuracy (UNAC), and uncertainty precision (UNPR); the classification threshold was set at 0.3. Results The UNSE of the DenseNet model was low but increased over the studied decremental noise range (-6 to 24 dB), indicating that the model grew more confident in classifying the signals as they got less noisy. The model became more certain in its predictions from SNR values of 12 dB and 18 dB onwards, yielding UNAC values of 80% and 82.4% for em and ma noise signals, respectively. UNSP and UNPR values were close to 100% for em and ma noise signals, indicating that the model was self-aware of what it knew and didn't. Conclusion Through this work, it has been established that the model is reliable as it was able to convey when it was not confident in the diagnostic information it was presenting. Thus, the model is trustworthy and can be used in healthcare applications, such as the emergency diagnosis of MI on ECGs.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, the uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis of a mathematical model of the SARS-CoV-2 virus transmission dynamics with mass vaccination strategy has been carried out. More specifically, a compartmental epidemic model has been considered, in which vaccination, social distance measures, and testing of susceptible individuals have been included. Since the application of these mitigation measures entails a degree of uncertainty, the effects of the uncertainty about the application of social distance actions and testing of susceptible individuals on the disease transmission have been quantified, under the assumption of a mass vaccination program deployment. A spectral approach has been employed, which allows the uncertainty propagation through the epidemic model to be represented by means of the polynomial chaos expansion of the output random variables. In particular, a statistical moment-based polynomial chaos expansion has been implemented, which provides a surrogate model for the compartments of the epidemic model, and allows the statistics, the probability distributions of the interesting output variables of the model at a given time instant to be estimated and the sensitivity analysis to be conducted. The purpose of the sensitivity analysis is to understand which uncertain parameters have most influence on a given output random variable of the model at a given time instant. Several numerical experiments have been conducted whose results show that the proposed spectral approach to uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis of epidemic models provides a useful tool to control and mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, when it comes to healthcare resource planning.",

        "abstract": "Mathematical modeling of epidemiological diseases using differential equations are of great importance in order to recognize the characteristics of the diseases and their outbreak. The procedure of modeling consists of two essential components: the first component is to solve the mathematical model numerically, the so-called forward modeling. The second component is to identify the unknown parameter values in the model, which is known as inverse modeling and leads to identifying the epidemiological model more precisely. The main goal of this paper is to develop the forward and inverse modeling of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic using novel computational methodologies in order to accurately estimate and predict the pandemic. This leads to governmental decisions support in implementing effective protective measures and prevention of new outbreaks. To this end, we use the logistic equation and the SIR (susceptible-infected-removed) system of ordinary differential equations to model the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. For the inverse modeling, we propose Bayesian inversion techniques, which are robust and reliable approaches, in order to estimate the unknown parameters of the epidemiological models. We deploy an adaptive Markov-chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for the estimation of a posteriori probability distribution and confidence intervals for the unknown model parameters as well as for the reproduction number. We perform our analyses on the publicly available data for Austria to estimate the main epidemiological model parameters and to study the effectiveness of the protective measures by the Austrian government. The estimated parameters and the analysis of fatalities provide useful information for decision-makers and makes it possible to perform more realistic forecasts of future outbreaks. According to our Bayesian analysis for the logistic model, the growth rate and the carrying capacity are estimated respectively as 0.28 and 14974. Moreover for the parameters of the SIR model, namely the transmission rate and recovery rate, we estimate 0.36 and 0.06, respectively. Additionally, we obtained an average infectious period of 17 days and a transmission period of 3 days for COVID-19 in Austria. We also estimate the reproduction number over time for Austria. This quantity is estimated around 3 on March 26, when the first recovery was reported. Then it decays to 1\u00a0at the beginning of April. Furthermore, we present a fatality analysis for COVID-19 in Austria, which is also of importance for governmental protective decision-making. According to our analysis, the case fatality rate (CFR) is estimated as 4% and a prediction of the number of fatalities for the coming 10 days is also presented. Additionally, the ICU bed usage in Austria indicates that around 2% of the active infected individuals are critical cases and require ICU beds. Therefore, if Austrian governmental protective measures would not have taken place and for instance if the number of active infected cases would have been around five times larger, the ICU bed capacity could have been exceeded.",
